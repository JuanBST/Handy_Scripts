The Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) classification system categorizes patients into groups based on clinical conditions, types of treatment and procedures, and levels of resources utilized. Dividing the entire DRG system into 5 or 6 groups by their affordability posing quite a complex problem since the DRG system has over 700 categories and it depends on many factors.

However, one possible approach is to group DRGs by Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs) combined with cost levels. A typical DRG is based on three factors: primary diagnosis, treatment procedures, and the patient's discharge status. 

Here is an example of how you may decide to categorize them:

Group 1: High-Cost and High-Complexity DRG ($$$)
- DRG related to Major Organ Transplantation or Heart/Lung Transplantation
- DRG related to Bone Marrow Transplants

Group 2: Medium-Cost and High-Complexity DRG ($$)
- DRG related to Severe Infectious Diseases
- DRG related to Severe Cardiovascular Conditions
- DRG related to Severe Chronic Conditions

Group 3: Medium-Cost and Medium-Complexity DRG ($$)
- DRG related to Abuse or Dependence on Drugs/Substance
- DRG related to Moderate Cardiovascular Conditions
- DRG related to Moderate Infectious Diseases

Group 4: Low-Cost and Low-Complexity DRG ($)
- DRG related to Minor Cardiovascular Conditions
- DRG related to Minor Infectious Diseases
- DRG related to Minor Surgical Procedures

Group 5: Preventative and Observation DRG ($)
- DRG related to Screenings and Evaluations
- DRG related to Observations 
- DRG related to Counseling/Prevention

This is just an idea, the specific division will depend on the Hospital budget and resources and how they provider they services. A healthcare management consultant or specialist should take on this task to adjust the groups for the specific hospital/healthcare provider's needs and capabilities. 

For a full list of DRG codes, you can find them in the CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) website as they provide a full list in a downloadable format. It's impossible to provide a full list in a response here due to the extensive number of the codes. Furthermore, codes might be different from country to country with International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). Ensure to get professional advice locally.
