      "To read cookies in your Flask application, you can use the `request.cookies.get()` method. To set cookies, you can use the Flask's make_response method coupled with `resp.set_cookie` function. For your login case, you can set the user login ticket (CAS ticket) in cookie and it will be sent to the application with each request. This ticket can then either be checked at the application side or sent to the CAS server for validation in each request if required so. However, remember it is not secure to store such sensitive data in cookies. \n",

      "\n",
      "The modifications made to the login route in `app_routes.py` now save the cas_ticket from the CAS server in a cookie using Flask's `make_response` and `resp.set_cookie` functions. We then read this cookie in our JavaScript with a helper function, `getCookie(name)`. With this setup, you can manage the CAS ticket in a user's browser and use it as needed. Note that saving sensitive information in cookies comes with security vulnerabilities and should be dealt with caution.\n",
